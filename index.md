* Title: Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States

Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-
body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully
understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved
variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the
columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alter-
nating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool – isometric Gaussian
fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) – that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaus-
sian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS
represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than
the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the iso-
metric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional
isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential
circuit construction of depth O(Lx·Ly ) compared to the original isoTNS of depth O(Lx + Ly ).
Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numer-
ical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for
ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and
the px +ipy mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS
as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field
Ising model.

### Seminar 2
* Date: August 12, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Po-Yao Chang (National Tsing Hua University)
* Title: Diagnosing Many-Body Systems with Entanglement: Insights from Non-Unitary CFTs and TQFTs

Entanglement measures are essential tools for characterizing quantum many-body phases of matter. In (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), entanglement entropy typically exhibits logarithmic scaling, with the coefficient yielding the central charge. However, for non-unitary CFTs, this central charge can be negative, leading to seemingly problematic negative entanglement entropy. We address this by introducing a generalized entanglement entropy that successfully extracts these negative central charges, demonstrated with several examples. Furthermore, in (2+1)-dimensional systems described by topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the subleading term of entanglement entropy, known as the topological entanglement entropy (TEE), encodes crucial information about quasiparticle statistics. This talk will also present a topological derivation of the strong subadditivity of TEE.

### Seminar 3
* Date: August 26, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Mingu Kang
* Title: Three different charge orders in kagome lattice materials

Kagome lattice is one of the most fertile geometric motifs in condensed matter physics, where a unique interplay between topology, correlation, and frustration gives rise to a plethora of quantum phenomena. Charge ordering is an example of quantum states prevalently observed in various Kagome lattice materials, including AV&#8323;Sb&#8325;, ScV&#8326;Sn&#8326;, and FeGe, and is found to be intertwined with superconductivity, magnetism, and anomalous Hall effect in a nontrivial manner.

In this talk, I will present our comprehensive investigations of charge orders in Kagome lattice materials using a suite of scattering and spectroscopy techniques, including ARPES and time-resolved XRD. Our results point toward that despite their apparently similar phenomenology, the charge orders in AV&#8323;Sb&#8325;, ScV&#8326;Sn&#8326;, and FeGe each have a completely different nature, emerging from electronic instability, lattice instability, and magnetism-driven transition, respectively. Our investigations not only provide guidance on the classification of charge order in broader quantum materials, but also highlight the utility of combining complementary photon science techniques – photon-in-electron-out, photon-in-photon-out, static and time-resolved – for a deeper understanding of quantum phenomena in solids.

### Seminar 4
* Date: September 2, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Tsung-Han Lee
* Title: Ghost Rotationally-Invariant Slave-Boson Approach to Strongly Correlated Materials

The rotationally-invariant slave-boson (RISB) approach is a highly efficient method for simulating strongly correlated systems [1]. When combined with density functional theory (DFT+RISB), it becomes a powerful tool for studying strong correlation effects in materials. However, despite its efficiency, the RISB method sometimes suffers from insufficient accuracy, leading to inaccurate descriptions of material properties, such as an overestimated effective mass of Sr 2 RuO 4 and a
larger critical Coulomb interaction for Mott transitions [2].

In this talk, I will introduce a systematic way to enhance the accuracy of RISB by introducing auxiliary ghost orbitals, which we refer to as the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson (gRISB) method, or equivalently, ghost-Gutzwiller approximation [3]. I will first present examples of binary transition metal oxides where DFT+RISB necessitates the use of unrealistic Coulomb parameters, significantly deviating from first-principle calculated values, to reproduce the experimental observations [2]. Subsequently, I will demonstrate how DFT+gRISB offers a systematic approach to improve the accuracy of DFT+RISB, enabling accurate descriptions of
correlated materials with realistic Coulomb interactions [4,5,6]. Finally, I will discuss recent applications of gRISB, including its role in capturing the structural distortion phase transition in SrMoO₃ and its extension to response function calculations [7].

* Date: October 14, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Tatsuya Miki (Tohoku University)
* Title: First-principles Calculations of Electron Chirality in Solids

Chiral materials have attracted significant attention for their unique electronic phenomena, such as cross-correlation responses, chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), and circular dichroism. To understand and control the material chirality, it is important to consider the quantitative measure that can continuously characterize the chirality of electrons, going beyond the binary distinction of "left" and "right" [1]. Recently, electron chirality, based on relativistic quantum theory, has been proposed as a quantitative measure of chirality [2]. However, it is still unclear which physical parameters in solids control electron chirality and how this connects to the experimentally observable quantity.

In this talk, we will present the results of quantitative evaluations of the electron chirality using first-principles calculations [3]. The electron chirality exhibits rapid sign changes with respect to the chemical potential, indicating the possibility of controlling right- and left-handed electrons through the small chemical potential shift, such as electron or hole doping. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that electron chirality can be observed experimentally by using circularly polarized light in photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, to gain clearer insight into the origin of electron chirality, we also study simplified atomic models with chiral crystal fields and will present the results of this analysis [4].

### Seminar 7
* Date: October 28, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Manato Fujimoto (University of Tokyo)
* Title: Four Moiré materials at One Magic Angle in Helical Quadrilayer Graphene

We introduce helical twisted quadrilayer graphene (HTQG)—four graphene sheets rotated by the same small angle—as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for correlated topological matter. HTQG consists of three moiré lattices, formed by interference between adjacent graphene layers, that are twisted relative to each other. Lattice relaxation produces four types of large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking of the three moiré lattices and come in two types: Type-I “Bernal" stacking and Type-II “rhombohedral" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the supermoiré and super-supermoiré scales. Remarkably, all four moiré substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle θ ≈2.3◦, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in device manufacturing. We argue that the Type-I domains are especially suitable for realizing robust superconductivity which emerges from doping topological insulators, and Chern insulators in C= ±2 bands.

### Seminar 8
* Date: December 23, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Gil Young Cho (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)
* Title: Most Two-Dimensional Bosonic Topological Orders Forbid Sign-Problem-Free Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation: Nonpositive Gauss Sum as an Indicator

Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the “intrinsic” sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence “sign-problem-free.” Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, the gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulation may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.
