## Seminar Schedule

- [Seminar 1: Yantao Wu, "Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States"](#seminar-1)

### Seminar 1
* Date: July 15, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST 
* Speaker: Yantao Wu (Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences)<br>
* Bio: Yantao Wu is an associate professor at the Instittute of Physics in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained a B.S. in physics from Harvey Mudd College, and a PhD in physics from Princeton University. He was trained as a postdoc in UC Berkeley and RIKEN. He is broadly interested in the computational aspect of statistical physics, tensor networks, and quuantum information.

* Title: Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States

Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-
body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully
understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved
variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the
columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alter-
nating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool – isometric Gaussian
fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) – that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaus-
sian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS
represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than
the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the iso-
metric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional
isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential
circuit construction of depth O(Lx·Ly ) compared to the original isoTNS of depth O(Lx + Ly ).
Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numer-
ical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for
ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and
the px +ipy mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS
as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field
Ising model.
