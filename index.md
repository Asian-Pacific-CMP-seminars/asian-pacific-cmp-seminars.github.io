* Title: Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States

Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-
body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully
understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved
variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the
columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alter-
nating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool – isometric Gaussian
fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) – that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaus-
sian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS
represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than
the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the iso-
metric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional
isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential
circuit construction of depth O(Lx·Ly ) compared to the original isoTNS of depth O(Lx + Ly ).
Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numer-
ical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for
ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and
the px +ipy mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS
as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field
Ising model.

### Seminar 2
* Date: August 12, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Po-Yao Chang (National Tsing Hua University)
* Title: Diagnosing Many-Body Systems with Entanglement: Insights from Non-Unitary CFTs and TQFTs

Entanglement measures are essential tools for characterizing quantum many-body phases of matter. In (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), entanglement entropy typically exhibits logarithmic scaling, with the coefficient yielding the central charge. However, for non-unitary CFTs, this central charge can be negative, leading to seemingly problematic negative entanglement entropy. We address this by introducing a generalized entanglement entropy that successfully extracts these negative central charges, demonstrated with several examples. Furthermore, in (2+1)-dimensional systems described by topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the subleading term of entanglement entropy, known as the topological entanglement entropy (TEE), encodes crucial information about quasiparticle statistics. This talk will also present a topological derivation of the strong subadditivity of TEE.

### Seminar 3
* Date: August 26, 2025 (Tuesday) 11:00 JST-12:00 JST
* Speaker: Mingu Kang
* Title: Three different charge orders in kagome lattice materials

Kagome lattice is one of the most fertile geometric motifs in condensed matter physics, where a unique interplay between topology, correlation, and frustration gives rise to a plethora of quantum phenomena. Charge ordering is an example of quantum states prevalently observed in various Kagome lattice materials, including AV~3~Sb~5~, ScV~6~Sn~6~, and FeGe, and is found to be intertwined with superconductivity, magnetism, and anomalous Hall effect in a nontrivial manner.

In this talk, I will present our comprehensive investigations of charge orders in Kagome lattice materials using a suite of scattering and spectroscopy techniques, including ARPES and time-resolved XRD. Our results point toward that despite their apparently similar phenomenology, the charge orders in AV&#8323;Sb&#8325;, ScV&#8326;Sn&#8326;, and FeGe each have a completely different nature, emerging from electronic instability, lattice instability, and magnetism-driven transition, respectively. Our investigations not only provide guidance on the classification of charge order in broader quantum materials, but also highlight the utility of combining complementary photon science techniques – photon-in-electron-out, photon-in-photon-out, static and time-resolved – for a deeper understanding of quantum phenomena in solids.
