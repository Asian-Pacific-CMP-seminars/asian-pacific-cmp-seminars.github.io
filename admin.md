Subject: Invitation to speak at Asia-Pacific Condensed Matter Physics Seminar

Dear Dr. [Speaker's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing on behalf of the organizing committee of the Asia-Pacific Condensed Matter Physics (AP-CMP) Seminar series to invite you to give a talk in our upcoming seminars.

The AP-CMP seminar is an online seminar series that brings together researchers from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond to promote scientific exchange and collaboration in condensed matter physics. Our seminars are held on Tuesdays at 11:00 JST (though we can be flexible with timing to accommodate different time zones) and typically run for one hour including Q&A.

We would be honored to have you share your recent research with our community. Based on your excellent work in [specific research area], we believe your insights would be of great interest to our audience.

Key details about the seminar:
- Format: Online via Zoom
- Duration: 1 hour (including Q&A)
- Typical time: Tuesday 11:00 JST (flexible based on your availability)
- Audience: Researchers from Asia-Pacific region and international participants
- Broadcasting and Recording: All seminars are broadcast live on KouShare (https://www.koushare.com), a professional academic streaming platform, and the recordings are made available for replay to benefit the broader scientific community

**Important: Recording Permission Required**
We will need your explicit permission to record your presentation and make it available on KouShare for future viewing. This helps us reach a wider audience and allows researchers who cannot attend the live session to benefit from your talk.

If you are interested, we would be happy to work with you to find a suitable date. Please let us know:
1. Your availability in the coming months
2. **Your permission to record the seminar and broadcast it live/replay it on KouShare**
3. A preliminary title and abstract for your talk

Thank you for considering our invitation. We look forward to hearing from you.
